# Caddy, HTTPS, TLS, certs

## General Notes:
- DNS = routes a request to the server (which has caddy in it)
- Caddy = routes the request internally within the computer (server machine) after the DNS has routed it
    - it will map the request to static files or servers running simon/startup for our purposes
- Web Certificates = sends a nonce to the person owning the web certificate when a request is made. Nonce must be sent back to authenticate

### HTTP/HTTPS:
- HTTP = Non-secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - Without a secure connection, anyone that had access to the network traffic could easily capture all data
- HTTPS = Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - Secure connection happens before any data exchanged
    - Secure connection means all data is encrypted using TLS protocol
    - TLS negotiates a shared secret that is used to encrypt data
- Modern browseers expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS
    - next version of HTTP only supports secure connections

### Web Certificates:
- generated by trusted 3rd party
certificate issuer responsible for verifying certificate owner actually owns domain name represented by certificate

### Caddy:
- uses Let's Encrypt to generate web certificate every time HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have web certificate for
