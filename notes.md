# GitHub

## How to Commit Changes:
1. Make the change
2. Type the command "git add ." in the git bash terminal
3. Type the command "git commit" in the terminal
4. Type the command "git push" in the terminal
5. To pull changes down from github, type "git pull"
6. Use "git status" to see how the local cloned repository compares to the github repository

# Markdown Syntax

## Styling text:
- wrap w/ "**" = bold
- wrap w/ "* *" = italic
- wrap w/ "~~" = strikethrough
- wrap w/ "***" = all bold italic
- precede quoted text with ">"

# Amazon Web Services - EC2

## Things to Remember:
- command to remote shell into the server = "ssh -i documents/cs260/my_first_key_pair.pem ubuntu@3.86.141.52"
- server elastic IP address = 3.86.141.52

# Caddy, HTTPS, TLS, certs

## General Notes:
- DNS = routes a request to the server (which has caddy in it)
- Caddy = routes the request internally within the computer (server machine) after the DNS has routed it
    - it will map the request to static files or servers running simon/startup for our purposes
- Web Certificates = sends a nonce to the person owning the web certificate when a request is made. Nonce must be sent back to authenticate

### HTTP/HTTPS:
- HTTP = Non-secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - Without a secure connection, anyone that had access to the network traffic could easily capture all data
    - it is the communication network between web browser and web server
        - normally web browser needs to request data from the web server
        - you need web sockets for it to be bi-directional
- HTTPS = Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - Secure connection happens before any data exchanged
    - Secure connection means all data is encrypted using TLS protocol
    - TLS negotiates a shared secret that is used to encrypt data
- Modern browseers expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS
    - next version of HTTP only supports secure connections

### Web Certificates:
- generated by trusted 3rd party
certificate issuer responsible for verifying certificate owner actually owns domain name represented by certificate

### Caddy:
- uses Let's Encrypt to generate web certificate every time HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have web certificate for

# HTML

### Basic Structure
- DOCTYPE - tells what version of html you're using
- html - page container
- Head - meta data (doesn't render)
    - Title - often put in the tab
- Body - stuff that renders on the page
- header - header content
- main - main content of page
- footer - footer of main content
- section - a section of main content

### Elements
- div - block division of content
- span - inline (within a block) span of content
- h1-h9 - text heading (h1 is biggest, h9 is smallest)
- p - paragraph
- table - a table bruh
- ol, ul - ordered list & unorder list
- a - anchor tag (for hyperlink)
- img - graphical image reference
- radio - mutually exclusive choice
- checkbox - choice, but not exlusive
- menu - another container for list items

### How HTML Works
- computer converts the html file into an in-memory tree
- JavaScript and other stuff can mess with the tree to render it in a certain way
- When a computer calls a web server to load a webpage, it will automatically load index.html if the call is not specified. 
    - **Name your base landing page index.html**

# CSS

## Rule Sets
- Padding --> between content and border
- Margin --> space between two blocks
- hsl --> hue, saturation and light (hue, saturation, light)

## Fonts, Animation, Practice
- Fonts
    - San Serif - only major strokes
    - Serif - minor strokes off major strokes
    - Monospace - all letters have same size
    - *go to fonts.google for more fonts*
    - Importing on style sheets:
        - use "@import url(https...com)"
- Sizing:
    - vh (vertical height) is based off of the display size
    - percentage is based off of the parent element
    - em is the size of the character of m
- Unicode and UTF-8:
    - put "charset="UTF-8"" in the meta section
    - allows you to write in all different types of languages in your html
- Animations:
    - under the desired element:
        - use animation-name: demo; and animation-duration: (time); to create an animation
        - use "alternate" to go back and forth between beginning and end of animation
    - then after that element, us:
        - @keyframes (name of animation) {} to define the animation
        - Use from...to inside the definition to define what it will start at and what it will end at
- Additional Notes:
    - :root --> a selector that assigns attributes it holds to all other selectors
    - !IMPORTANT --> decorator that forces an attribute to take priority

## Responsive, grid, flex
- Float --> makes something go to a certain side of the page (left or right)
    - right is also same as inline-end (sends it to the end of the text - so in arabic inline-end would be left)
    - inline-start is the opposite equivalent
- Display Type:
    - Block --> width expands to fill up width of parent (like a paragraph)
    - Inline --> marking up a portion of bigger text; width is defined to be content size (like a text-box)
    - Grid --> effects the children of the element, not the element itself, nor its grandchildren
    - Flex --> also controls the children
        - Column --> flexes downward
        - flex: 0 means that you don't want it to flex at all
        - basis: the number of pixels you add on to the flex (which is a fractional unit) after the flex is given

## CSS Debugging, Frameworks, Simon
- Frameworks:
    - the bootstrap stylesheet is linked under the head element
    - the javascript is linked at the end of your body element

# JavaScript

## General Notes
- Officially called ECMAScript
- Inspired by Scheme
- Interpreted
- Dynamically typed
- Most popular programing language in the world
- Three ways to add js to html file:
    - Script attribute - put the js directly in to the attribute tag of the element using it
    - Script tag - ass a script tag after the body tag and put your js in that
        - You need to put it after the body tag so that if it uses any of the html in the file, that html has already been rendered
- Put semicolons at the end of statements, curly brackets for loops and functions
- Name js file "main.js"
- Declaring Variables:
    - syntax "let" for declaring variables:
        - "let x = 1"
        - OR "const" z = 4

## Types, Operators, Conditionals & Loops
- Types
    - null = empty value (but it is a null object)
    - undefined = undefined variable (truly not an object or type)
    - string = same as other languages
    - number = integer
    - object = essentialy a map (name-vaule pairs. Name is a symbol)
        - use x = {} as short script to create a new object
    - array = is of object rype
    - function = function is a first-order type
        - can return any type from a function
        - if you don't return anything, it will return undefined
    - Dynamic Conversions:
        - JS attempts to add different types together when you tell it to:
            - Thus 'rat' + [' fink'] would give you 'rat fink'
            - adding an int and a string, js would convert the int to a string and then add the strings
- Operators
    - equality -> "==="
    - and -> "&&"
    - or -> "||"
- Conditionals
    - falsy (false, 0, -0, '', NaN, null, undefined)
    - truthy = !falsy
- Loops
    - For:
        - basically same syntax as c/c++
    - While:
        - again, use "break" to break out
    - Switch:
        - code with "cases" inside it -> case is executed if matches case requirement
        - program will continue on to next case without a break
        - default is the case that runs given that it matches none of the case requirements

## Functions, objects, classes, JSON
- Functions:
    - Syntax -> function name(parameter) {}
    - Functions are primary types in JS
    - Anonymous functions:
        - Function without a name -> function (parameter) {}
        - Can assign the function to a variable, which can be used to call the function
    - Functions w/o Return Types:
        - Returns undefined
    - JS has optional parameters:
        - f = function (a, b, c = 'rat') { return [a, b, c]}
        - f(1) would return [1, undefined, 'rat']
    - Arrow Functions:
        - Single line with implicit return, inherits this binding
        - Syntax:
            - function name() { const arrow = () => 1; const arrowWith Block = (a) => {a;}}
            - define the name of the function, assign the number of parameters, and what to do with the parameters
            - looks kinda like a function within a function
    - Closures:
        - A function and its surrounding state when it got created
