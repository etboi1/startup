# Markdown Syntax

# Amazon Web Services - EC2

## Things to Remember:
- command to remote shell into the server = "ssh -i documents/cs260/my_first_key_pair.pem ubuntu@3.86.141.52"
- server elastic IP address = 3.86.141.52

# Caddy, HTTPS, TLS, certs

## General Notes:
- DNS = routes a request to the server (which has caddy in it)
- Caddy = routes the request internally within the computer (server machine) after the DNS has routed it
    - it will map the request to static files or servers running simon/startup for our purposes
- Web Certificates = sends a nonce to the person owning the web certificate when a request is made. Nonce must be sent back to authenticate

### HTTP/HTTPS:
- HTTP = Non-secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - Without a secure connection, anyone that had access to the network traffic could easily capture all data
    - it is the communication network between web browser and web server
        - normally web browser needs to request data from the web server
        - you need web sockets for it to be bi-directional
- HTTPS = Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
    - Secure connection happens before any data exchanged
    - Secure connection means all data is encrypted using TLS protocol
    - TLS negotiates a shared secret that is used to encrypt data
- Modern browseers expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS
    - next version of HTTP only supports secure connections

### Web Certificates:
- generated by trusted 3rd party
certificate issuer responsible for verifying certificate owner actually owns domain name represented by certificate

### Caddy:
- uses Let's Encrypt to generate web certificate every time HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have web certificate for

# HTML

### Basic Structure
- DOCTYPE - tells what version of html you're using
- html - page container
- Head - meta data (doesn't render)
    - Title - often put in the tab
- Body - stuff that renders on the page
- header - header content
- main - main content of page
- footer - footer of main content
- section - a section of main content

### Elements
- div - block division of content
- span - inline (within a block) span of content
- h1-h9 - text heading (h1 is biggest, h9 is smallest)
- p - paragraph
- table - a table bruh
- ol, ul - ordered list & unorder list
- a - anchor tag (for hyperlink)
- img - graphical image reference

### How HTML Works
- computer converts the html file into an in-memory tree
- JavaScript and other stuff can mess with the tree to render it in a certain way
- When a computer calls a web server to load a webpage, it will automatically load index.html if the call is not specified. 
    - **Name your base landing page index.html**
