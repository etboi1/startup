### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been on a road trip or waiting in line with a buddy and the conversation stalls? Then you awkwardly each go on your phones to check social media or otherwise waste time. Instead, you could spend your time interacting with your friend and playing a game that grows your mind! The "Chess is Fun!" app makes it so that two people can pull out their phones and play chess together without the need for a physical board.
